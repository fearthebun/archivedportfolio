    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <br>

    <text>An array is a data structure used to implement a list object, where the elements in the list 
    are of the same type: int, String, char, double, boolean, etc. For an array of N 
    elements in Java, index values (“subscripts”) go from 0 to N−1. If an array index 
    smaller than 0 or ≥ N is accessed, and ArrayOutOfBoundsExcept is thrown.

    <br>
    <br>
    To initialize an array, which is treated as an object, the keyword new must be used. 
    An array can be initialized one of three ways:
    <br>
    <br>
        int [] arr = new int [5];<br><br>
    
        int arr [] = new int [5];<br><br>
    
        int [] arr; 
        arr = new int [5];<br>
    <br>
    Another way to initialize arrays is to declare an array with an initializer list if 
    the array’s values are known:
    <br>
    <br>
        int [] arr = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    <br>
    <br>
    Once an array is initialized, its size cannot be changed unless it is reinitialized. 
    This, however, will cause previous data stored within it to be discarded. If an array 
    is not initialized, it is automatically initialized; in a primitive numeric data type 
    array, elements are set to 0, for boolean they are set to false, and for object references 
    they are set to null. 
    <br>
    <br>
    To find the length of an array, simply use length, a final public instance variable:
    <br>
    <br>
        System.out.print (arr.length);    //will print out 5
    <br>
    <br>
    This allows for the traversal through and modification of an array of an unknown size 
    with a for loop:
    <br>
    <br>
        for (int x = 0; x < arr.length; x++)
        {
            System.out.println (arr[x]);    //will print out all elements in the array.
            arr[x] += 1;    //adds 1 to the element
        }
    <br>
    <br>
    Another way to traverse through an array is the for-each loop. This loop, however, cannot 
    replace or remove elements unless it is an array of objects and mutator methods of that object 
    are being used. A correct usage of the for-each loop would be as follows:
    <br>
    <br>
        int count = 0;
        for (int x : arr)
            if (x < 0)
                count++;
        System.out.print (count);    //will print out the number of negative numbers in the array
    <br>
    <br>
    Arrays are, as mentioned previously, treated as objects in Java. Therefore, passing an array 
    as a parameter means it is passed by reference. Any changes made in the method to the array is 
    made to the actual elements of the array.</text>
    
    <h1>Two-Dimensional Arrays</h1>
A two-dimensional array, also called a matrix, is essentially coordinate grid or array elements. 
    It is useful for representing data like classroom seating, a table, or a maze. As with a regular 
    array, 2D arrays can be initialized with or without length, with length, or with an initializer 
    list:
        int [][] arr;
        arr = new int [3][3];
    
        int [][] arr = new int [3][3];
    
        int [][] arr = {{0, 1, 2}
                    {3, 4, 5}
            {6, 7, 8}};
    
    In the last example, we can see that:
        arr [0] contains {0, 1, 2}
        arr [1] contains {3, 4, 5}
        arr [2] contains {6, 7, 8}
    
    To access elements in a 2D array, simply access the row, then column:
        System.out.println (arr[0][2]);    //will print out 6
    
    Doing arr.length in this scenario would give the number of rows, which, in this case, 
    would be 3. To find the number of columns, use arr[k].length, where k is larger than or 
    equal to 0 but smaller than arr.length.
    
    There are 3 ways to traverse a 2D array:
    row-column (accessing, modifying class objects, or replacing elements)
    for (int r = 0; r < arr.length; r++)
    {
        for (int c = 0; c < arr[r].length; c++)
        {
            arr [r][c] += 1;    //adds 1 to each element in the array
        }
    }
    for-each loops (accessing, modifying class objects, but no replacement)
    for (int [] row : arr)
        for (int element : row)
            System.out.println (element);    //prints out each element in the array 
    row-by-row array processing (accessing, modifying, or replacing)
    for (int c = 0; c < arr [2].length; c++)
    mat[2][c] += 1;    //adds 1 to each element in the last row
    
    <h1>ArrayLists</h1>
An ArrayList is simply a resizable array that is both memory efficient and run-time 
    efficient. It implements the List interface. When the ArrayList class is called, it 
    requires a type parameter:
        List <String> arrList = new ArrayList <String>();
    
    This example ArrayList can only store String objects.
    
    Some important methods useful when handling ArrayLists are the following: 
    add (Object o)    //adds the object to the end of the list if it is of the same object type 
                        as the list; otherwise, a ClassCastException is thrown

    add (int index, Object o)  //inserts given object at the index given; pushes all 
                                elements after the index back by 1

    remove (int index)    //removes element at given index

    size ()    //returns the length of the list

    get (int index)    //returns the element at given index

    set (int index, Object o)    //replaces the object at given index with given object
    
    Traversing through an ArrayList is usually done with a for-each loop.
