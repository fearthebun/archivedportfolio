<h1>Searches</h1>
    <text><h3>Sequential Search</h3>
    A sequential search simply traverses an entire array, comparing each element
        with a key until it is found. This searching algorithm has a time complexity of O(N),
        as it only traverses through the array once.
    <h3>Binary Search</h3>
If searching through a sorted array, binary searchâ€™s divide-and-conquer approach
    is far more time efficient than sequential search. Binary search uses a recursive
    method that checks the middle of the array from 0 to array length, and compares the key
    to the element. Say the array is sorted in ascending order. If the key is not equal to the element,
    it checks if it is smaller or larger than the current element. If the key is smaller, it continues the
    recursion with a smaller subarray of 0 to middle-1 as there is no possibility of it being in the second
    half of the array where the elements will be increasing in value. The opposite is true if the key is larger
    than the middle element. This recursion continues until the key is found or the array can no longer be traversed
    further. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log N).</text>
