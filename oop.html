    <h1>OOP</h1>
    <br>

    <text>Object-Oriented Programming, otherwise known as OOP, is a style of programming which aims for a real-world
        simulation of the uses of objects. Objects are created, then manipulated. Every object has a state and behaviour.
        For example, some states an object “Animal” could have is colour, weight, name, or hunger level. Behaviours for
        the same object could include eating, moving, and sleeping.
<br>
        Now, these objects must be set up somehow. That’s where classes come in -
        software blueprints from which objects can be created. Objects states are declared
        with instance variables which are initialized with class constructors, and behaviours made with methods.
        An example of a class is the following:
        <br>
        <pre>public class Animal {
    private String colour;
    private double weight;
    private String name;
    private int hungerLevel;

public Animal(String c, double w, String n)
{
    colour = c;
    weight = w;
    name = n;
    hungerLevel = 10;
}
}
</pre><br>
        To create a new Animal object, simply instantiate a new Animal object in the main method:<br>
        <pre>public static void main (String [] args)
{
    Animal a = new Animal (“white”, 1.5, “Fluffy”);
}
</pre><br>
        Now that the basics of object-oriented programming have been covered, some core concepts must be explored in order to fully understand what object-oriented programming can really achieve.
        Core concepts of object-oriented programming include inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.<br>
