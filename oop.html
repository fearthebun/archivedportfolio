    <h1>OOP</h1>
    <br>

    <text>Object-Oriented Programming, otherwise known as OOP, is a style of programming which aims for a real-world
        simulation of the uses of objects. Objects are created, then manipulated. Every object has a state and behaviour.
        For example, some states an object “Animal” could have is colour, weight, name, or hunger level. Behaviours for
        the same object could include eating, moving, and sleeping.
<br>
        Now, these objects must be set up somehow. That’s where classes come in -
        software blueprints from which objects can be created. Objects states are declared
        with instance variables which are initialized with class constructors, and behaviours made with methods.
        An example of a class is the following:
        <br>
        <pre>public class Animal {
    private String colour;
    private double weight;
    private String name;
    private int hungerLevel;

public Animal(String c, double w, String n)
{
    colour = c;
    weight = w;
    name = n;
    hungerLevel = 10;
}
}
</pre><br>
        To create a new Animal object, simply instantiate a new Animal object in the main method:<br>
        <pre>public static void main (String [] args)
{
    Animal a = new Animal (“white”, 1.5, “Fluffy”);
}
</pre><br>
        Now that the basics of object-oriented programming have been covered, some core concepts must be explored in order to fully understand what object-oriented programming can really achieve.
        Core concepts of object-oriented programming include inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.<br>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <h4>Superclasses and Subclasses</h4>
        In object-oriented programming, all objects are made from a superclass template.
        Each object will have the attributes that the superclass sets up for it. Subclasses are classes
        of a more specific type of object, which extend a superclass and therefore inherit all of its
        attributes and methods while also being able to add others. This can be shown with a class hierarchy tree.
        insert the tree here

        The subclasses of Animal may look something like this:
        <pre>public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void makeNoise()
    {
        System.out.print (“Meow”);
    }
}

public class Rabbit extends Animal {
    public void makeNoise()
    {
        System.out.print (“Sniff”);
    }
}
</pre>
        Cat and Rabbit both extend the class Animal, while Siamese and Munchkin extend the Cat class. In this case, Siamese and Munchkin will both inherit attributes from Cat as well as Animal and Cat will inherit attributes from Animal. Therefore, Cat can use any methods from Animal, and Siamese and Munchkin can use methods from the Cat and Animal classes.

        <h4>Class Casting</h4>
        When initializing a class object with superclasses and subclasses involved, class casting occurs. A class can be upcasted or downcasted. A subclass upcasts to a superclass; this is done automatically by Java:

        <pre>Animal rabbit = new Rabbit();</pre>

        However, a manual class downcast would be required for a superclass to a subclass:

       <pre> Cat c = new Cat();
           Animal a = (Animal) c;</pre>

        <h4>Method Overriding</h4>
        Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass contains a method with the same method name and parameters as one in the superclass. An example of method overriding with the usage of the previously made Animal and Rabbit classes is as follows:

        <pre>public static void main (String [] args)
        {
        Animal a = new Cat();
        Animal b = new Rabbit();

        a.makeNoise();
        b.makeNoise();
            }</pre>

        This will output

        <pre>Meow
            Sniff</pre>

        Object a inherits the makeNoise() method from the subclass Cat, while b inherits it from the subclass Rabbit. The Java compiler runs the method of the object type.

        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        Encapsulation, also known as data-hiding, is an object-oriented programming technique which wraps data and code. Variables of a class are set to private, and as a result are hidden from other classes. They can only be accessed by way of accessor methods. An example of this is as follows:

        <pre>public class Human {
        private String name;

        public Human(String name) { this.name = name; }
        public String getName()   { return name; }
        @Override public String toString() { return "Human " + getName(); }
            }</pre>

        <h3>Abstraction</h3>
        Data abstraction is the displaying of merely the important details of the object rather than all the details to the user. Abstraction helps reduce the complexity of a program. This can be done achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

        <h4>Abstract Classes</h4>
        An abstract class is one created solely to be extended. It is made using the keyword abstract. It gives a basic outline of an object, which is later defined using a subclass. Not all methods in an abstract class must be abstract, however, any abstract method in the abstract class must be overridden in the subclass. An example of an appropriate use for an abstract class is the abstract class Shape.

        <pre>
        public abstract class Shape
        {
        protected abstract void draw (); // The method to draw the shape.
        protected abstract void erase (); // The method to erase the shape.
        }</pre>

        Its subclass, Rectangle, defines the methods draw and erase.

        <pre>
        public class Rectangle extends Shape
        {
        // Draw the shape.
        protected void draw ()
        {
            ...
        } // draw method

        // Erase the shape.
        protected void erase ()
        {
            ...
        } // erase method
        }</pre>

        An abstract class cannot be instantiated unless it has a subclass, like so:
        <pre>Shape s = new Rectangle();</pre>

        <h4>Interfaces</h4>
        An interface in Java is a variant of class which is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. It does not have a constructor, and all of its methods must be abstract or public. Furthermore, its methods have no implementation; it merely contains the signature, which is the method name and parameters. An interface cannot be instantiated. The keyword implements is used to implement an interface with a class. An interface can extend other interfaces, but it cannot implement other interfaces. An example of an interface is the following:

        <pre>
        public interface Colorable
        {
        public abstract void setColor (Color color);
        public abstract Color getColor ();
            }</pre>

        And the class that implements it:

        <pre>
        public class Text implements Colorable
        {
        // Change the color of the text.
        public void setColor (Color color)
        {
        textColor = color;
        paint ();
        } // setColor method

        // Get the current color of the text.
        public Color getColor ()
        {
        return textColor;
        } // getColor method
            }</pre>

        There are two differences between an interface class and an abstract one. Firstly, unlike an abstract class, an interface cannot provide implementations for its methods. Secondly, an interface cannot have instance variables. An interface class can, however, declare constants.
