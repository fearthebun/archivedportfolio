    <h1>Sorts</h1>
    <text><h3>Selection Sort</h3>
        Selection sort is a sorting algorithm which constantly finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and replaces it with the element after the last sorted element, until the array is
        fully sorted in ascending order. The time complexity of this sort is O(N^2).
        <h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
        Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which goes through array elements one by one and places it
        in the correct index within the sorted portion of the array, which starts off being the first element.
        It is similar to how one would sort a hand of cards. This sorting algorithm has a
        time complexity of O(N^2) for an average case, and is best used on smaller sized arrays.
    <h3>Mergesort</h3>
        Recursion is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that is considerably faster than selection and insertion sort.
        This algorithm works by using a recursive method to break the array into subarrays, all a length of 1 which are “sorted”.
        They are then recursively merged into sorted pairs. Once there are only two subarrays, the two subarrays merge into
        one sorted array. Mergesort has a time complexity of O(N log N), and is very efficient in sorting large arrays.
